20250729 松弛感
📌松弛感
今天学到了“松弛感”这个词语在家庭中的作用。拿我堂妹举例，每次她跟家里人沟通都是大声说话、不耐烦、叛逆。以前我以为是她青春期，长大后就自然变好了，直到上次她已然结婚仍然如此我才意识到这跟她的家庭环境有关。直到今天学到了“松弛感”这个词的真正含义，我好像才真正理解了堂妹。“家庭的松弛感”简单来说就是一个人在家庭中能否自在的做自己，不被打扰，不被评价，不被否定，而“松弛感”就是这个空间的表现形式。当你和一个人相处时，你可以慢一点说话，可以晚一点回消息，可以不必每句话都考虑对方怎么想，这才是亲密的基础。而在多数家庭里，恰恰是这一点最稀缺。父母焦虑、控制、碎碎念。子女防御、爆炸、情绪化。看似都在表达爱，其实都在传递压迫感。真正健康的关系，不是紧密的令人窒息，而是疏密有度，张弛有道。“松弛感”是关系中最深的安全感。了解了这个定义后，以后在任何的关系中一定要刻意营造松弛感来拉近与真正重要的人的距离。

20250804 Things That Are Important but Not Urgent and Can Change My Life
📌那些重要不紧急却能改变我一生的事
人快步入中年，身体和心智按理说也随之到达了一个顶峰的状态。比如偶尔一次的 5km间歇性冲刺，能够跑一口气跑下来，能够更专注的去完成一件事，对很多事情依然保持探索欲但会多一丝理智等等。
但是，我发现我却在最好的年纪过得并不如自己所意：每天早上 8：40起床，慌忙洗漱完毕赶去9点上班，接着中午刷一些国际大事、web3资讯、技术公众号等一些与自己无关的信息流。晚上下班后刷一些无聊的长视频，看一部电影，熬夜，躺床上，焦虑，晚睡，第二天如此循环往复。
我的内心告诉我这样并不对，不是我想要的生活，可是由于习惯和前一天的熬夜，导致我很苦恼。而上个周六因为要去早起去漂流，头天早早洗完澡就酝酿睡觉。第二天 5：30醒来，经历了一天繁忙而又充实的漂流之旅后我突然发现原来一天可以这么长。
我得出了一个结论：如果我能早睡早起，就能压缩晚上的时间而大幅拉长早上的时间，而人对两种看似同样的时间体感确实不一样的。并且我有一个习惯就是，我早起之后绝不会去做那些浪费我时间的事，我不会刷短视频、长视频，只想去做一天中最有意义的事：那些重要不紧急却能改变我一生的事。
早起后，我会先打开水龙头热水，接着撒尿，刷牙，健身 15分钟，健身间隙收拾床和屋子，健身完后洗个冷水澡，喝杯温水，冥想 10分钟，学习英语。在做这些事情时，没有焦虑和压力，取而代之的是强大的对自己生活的掌控感，并可以持续到自信规划一整天要做的事情，进而可以更认真的工作，吃的更健康，学习更专注，往自己的雅思目标更近一步。发现了吗，跟之前的习惯完全相反，而这仅仅是因为早睡早起。并且我的性格天生喜欢下班后完成白天的一些idea和未完成的事，那么因为我早上的那种感觉让人更爽更上瘾，下班后也不会报复性消费自己，而是想找回那种进步的快感。完全就是正向循环。甚至我可以引用改变当今AI时代的一句话：Attention/Sleep well is all you need！
我计划每晚写一篇关于今天的感想的中文日记并将他翻译成英语进行学习，负荷i+1、兴趣、近期相关性。我想用到了这些正确的方法，我一定会持续下去产生巨大的复利效果！

📌Things That Are Important but Not Urgent and Can Change My Life
As a person is approaching middle - age, both their body and mind are supposed to reach a peak state. For example, I can run a 5 - km intermittent sprint in one go occasionally. I can focus more on finishing one thing, and I still have a sense of curiosity about many things but with a bit more rationality.
However, I find that I'm not living the life I want in this prime age. I get up at 8:40 every morning, wash up in a hurry and rush to work at 9. Then at noon, I browse some information about international affairs, web3 news, technology official accounts and other information flows that have nothing to do with me. After work in the evening, I watch some boring long - videos, watch a movie, stay up late, lie in bed, feel anxious, go to bed late, and then repeat the next day.
My heart tells me this is not right and not the life I want. But because of my habits and staying up late the previous day, I'm very distressed. Last Saturday, because I had to get up early to go rafting, I took a bath early and started to get ready for bed. I woke up at 5:30 the next day. After a busy and fulfilling day of rafting, I suddenly found that a day could be so long.
I came to a conclusion: if I can go to bed early and get up early, I can shorten the evening time and greatly lengthen the morning time. And people do have different feelings about two seemingly same amounts of time. Also, I have a habit that after getting up early, I will never do things that waste my time. I won't watch short - videos or long - videos. I just want to do the most meaningful thing in a day: those things that are important but not urgent and can change my life.
After getting up early, I will first turn on the hot water faucet, then pee, brush my teeth, do 15 - minute exercise. During the exercise break, I clean the bed and the room. After the exercise, I take a cold shower, drink a cup of warm water, meditate for 10 minutes and study English. When doing these things, there is no anxiety or pressure. Instead, I have a strong sense of control over my life, and this feeling can last until I confidently plan what to do throughout the day. Then I can work more seriously, eat more healthily, study more attentively and get one step closer to my IELTS goal. Have you noticed? It's completely the opposite of my previous habits, and all this is just because of going to bed early and getting up early. And I'm naturally inclined to finish some ideas and unfinished things from the day after work. Because the feeling in the morning is so good and addictive, I won't consume myself in a retaliatory way after work. Instead, I want to regain that sense of progress. It's a complete positive cycle. I can even quote a sentence that has changed the AI era today: Attention/Sleep well is all you need!
I plan to write a Chinese diary about my feelings of the day every night and translate it into English for learning, following the principles of i + 1, interest and recent relevance. I think if I use these correct methods, I will surely keep going and achieve a huge compound effect!

📌Matters of Significance, Non - Urgency, and Life - Altering Potential
As one nears middle - age, both the physical and mental faculties are, ostensibly, at their zenith. For instance, I'm capable of completing a 5 - km intermittent sprint in one breath on occasion. I can devote more focused attention to accomplishing a task, and I retain an inquisitive spirit towards numerous matters, albeit tempered with a touch more rationality.
Nonetheless, I've come to realize that I'm not living up to my expectations during this prime of my life. Every morning, I rouse at 8:40, hastily wash up, and scurry off to work by 9. At noon, I peruse information regarding international affairs, web3 updates, technology - related official accounts, and other extraneous information streams. Post - work in the evenings, I indulge in mindless long - form videos, watch a movie, burn the midnight oil, lie in bed, besieged by anxiety, and eventually retire late, only to repeat the cycle the following day.
My inner self admonishes that this isn't the right path, not the life I aspire to. Yet, habitual patterns and the previous night's late - night escapades leave me in a state of distress. Last Saturday, due to the need to rise early for a rafting trip, I bathed early and prepared for slumber. I awoke at 5:30 the next morning. Following a day filled with the hustle and bustle of a fulfilling rafting adventure, I was struck by the realization that a day could be so expansive.
I've deduced that by adhering to an early - to - bed, early - to - rise routine, I can curtail my evening hours and significantly elongate my morning time. Intriguingly, our perception of time, even when of equal duration, can vary substantially. Moreover, I have a proclivity to refrain from engaging in time - wasting activities upon waking early. I eschew short - and long - form videos, opting instead to engage in the day's most meaningful pursuits: those endeavors that are crucial yet non - urgent and have the potential to transform my life.
Upon rising early, I initiate by turning on the hot water tap, then relieve myself, brush my teeth, and engage in a 15 - minute workout. During breaks in my exercise routine, I tidy my bed and the room. Post - workout, I take a revitalizing cold shower, sip on a cup of warm water, engage in 10 minutes of meditation, and delve into English studies. While undertaking these activities, anxiety and stress dissipate, replaced by a profound sense of life mastery. This sense of control persists as I confidently map out my daily agenda, enabling me to work with greater earnestness, maintain a healthier diet, study with enhanced concentration, and edge closer to my IELTS target. Notice how this contrasts starkly with my former habits? All this stems from the simple practice of early - to - bed, early - to - rise. Additionally, I'm innately disposed to completing tasks and ideas left over from the day post - work. Given the invigorating and addictive nature of the morning routine, I no longer feel the urge to engage in compensatory consumption after work. Instead, I'm driven to recapture that exhilarating sense of progress. It's a veritable positive feedback loop. I could even appropriate a phrase that has revolutionized the AI landscape: Attention/Sleep well is all you need!
I intend to pen a Chinese diary chronicling my daily musings each night and subsequently translate it into English for learning purposes, in line with the principles of i + 1, personal interest, and recent relevance. I'm convinced that by employing these proper methods, I'll sustain this routine and reap substantial compound benefits.

📌The Pivotal Yet Non - Urgent Affairs That Can Transform My Existence
As an individual approaches the threshold of middle - age, one would presume that both the corporeal and cognitive aspects of their being have attained a pinnacle of development. For example, I am occasionally capable of completing a 5 - km intermittent sprint without pause. I possess an augmented capacity to immerse myself fully in the execution of a task, and while I retain an inherent inquisitiveness towards a plethora of subjects, this is now tempered with a heightened degree of rational discernment.
However, I've unearthed a disconcerting truth: despite being in what should be the prime of my life, I'm not living in accordance with my envisioned narrative. Each morning, I rouse from my slumber at precisely 8:40, engage in a perfunctory ablution, and hasten to commence my workday at 9. Come noon, I am wont to peruse a medley of information encompassing international affairs, the ever - evolving realm of web3, technology - focused official accounts, and other sundry information streams that bear little direct relevance to my immediate life. In the evenings, subsequent to the conclusion of my workday, I succumb to the allure of mind - numbing long - form videos, indulge in a cinematic experience, and invariably find myself lingering in the late hours, ensconced in the confines of my bed, besieged by a tempest of anxiety, before finally succumbing to sleep. This cycle repeats itself with metronomic regularity each day.
My innermost being resonates with a dissonant chord, signaling that this trajectory is amiss, diverging from the life I aspire to lead. Yet, the shackles of habit, coupled with the residual effects of nocturnal indulgences from the previous evening, conspire to plunge me into a quagmire of distress. The previous Saturday, propelled by the anticipation of an early - morning rafting expedition, I retired early, cleansing my body in preparation for slumber. I awoke at the pre - dawn hour of 5:30. As the day unfolded, filled with the exhilarating crescendo of a bustling and fulfilling rafting escapade, a profound realization dawned upon me: the temporal expanse of a day can be both malleable and expansive.
I have arrived at a profound insight: by embracing the regimen of early retirement to bed and prompt awakening, I can effectively recalibrate the temporal allocation of my day, constricting the nocturnal hours and concurrently expanding the morning expanse. Intriguingly, our subjective perception of time, even when objectively equivalent in duration, can vary significantly. Moreover, I harbor an ingrained predilection to eschew activities that squander my time upon rising. I eschew the siren call of short - and long - form videos, instead electing to engage in the day's most consequential pursuits: those endeavors that, while not pressing in the immediate sense, hold the potential to effect a profound transformation in my life.
Upon rising, my morning ritual commences with the activation of the hot - water faucet. I then attend to my personal hygiene, brushing my teeth and relieving myself. Subsequently, I embark on a 15 - minute regimen of physical exercise. During intermittent breaks in my workout, I undertake the task of tidying my bed and the surrounding living space. Post - exercise, I invigorate my senses with a bracing cold shower, savor a cup of tepid water, engage in a 10 - minute sojourn of introspective meditation, and dedicate time to the study of the English language. Throughout these activities, a palpable sense of tranquility prevails, supplanting the specters of anxiety and stress with an empowering sense of self - mastery. This newfound sense of control permeates my consciousness as I methodically plan my daily activities, enabling me to approach my work with renewed vigor, make more discerning dietary choices, immerse myself more deeply in my studies, and inch ever closer to my IELTS aspirations. Observe how this diametrically opposes my erstwhile habits? All of this can be attributed to the simple yet profound practice of early - to - bed, early - to - rise. Furthermore, I possess an innate inclination to complete tasks and actualize ideas that have remained unfulfilled during the day, post - work. The invigorating and addictive nature of my morning routine has engendered a shift in my post - work behavior. No longer do I feel compelled to engage in compensatory consumption as a means of self - indulgence. Instead, I am propelled by an insatiable desire to recapture the exhilarating sense of progress and self - improvement. It is, in essence, a self - perpetuating positive feedback loop. I could even appropriate a maxim that has reverberated throughout the contemporary AI landscape: Attention/Sleep well is all you need!
I am resolved to document my daily reflections in a Chinese diary each evening and subsequently translate these musings into English for the purpose of language acquisition. In doing so, I will adhere to the principles of the i + 1 framework, personal interest, and topical relevance. I am firmly convinced that by consistently applying these methodologies, I will not only sustain this endeavor but also reap the cumulative rewards of a compounding effect.

20250807 What kind of life do you really want to live
📌你究竟想活出怎样的人生
    “你究竟想活出怎样的人生”，这绝对是一个直击灵魂深处的问题。随着我们逐渐长大、成熟，面对周围的环境，开始总结过去，思考未来，以及面对当下时，常常会有这样的困惑：现在好像也还好，但也许会更好，可能也会更糟。我应该活在当下吗，可是我又不能只活在当下，过去的已经过去了，难道我要把类似今天的日子重复过一辈子吗。不甘心，不接受，不服输。可我们也不是没有努力过，但好像一切都没有多大的改变，甚至在别人、影视角色、以及以为走到前边的那些人背后其实各种不如意，我打退堂鼓了。可是我们内心深处仍然找不到答案。但最近我发现了，答案就隐藏在问题之中。
    你究竟想活出怎样的人生这个问题本身就包含着改革与变动，只有一个崭新的、充满机会与挑战、到处都新鲜的星球才是我们想要的人生。高手解决问题的方式从来都不是面对问题本身，而是升维。
    具体来说，“悲观者正确，乐观者前行”，我以前以为是自己的欲望太大所以对现状不满意，到现在的欲望相较于以前大幅降低可仍然不满意时突然认识到一件残酷的事：人类需要不停的对抗熵。于是我后来的想法变为同样乐观，但以悲观为基础。因为我的悲观是为了不让自己陷入那种悲观的境地，而不是被悲观牵着鼻子走。如果说为了欲望我可以简单砍掉，但即将面对的裁员、身体健康失败、青春流逝、无法出国旅游、能自由的做自己热爱的事又不得不让我思考出路。
    我与周围很多同龄人甚至年长者不同的是，我想过也推演过无数可能的结果，包括学习AI、去深圳大城市寻找更好的大数据工作机会、闯入 web3 撸毛，投资，甚至赌博、接私活、入职外企、做独立开发者、去国外互联网公司工作。每一步我都开始做了，并在 AI 产品的加持下进行了推进及推演。但我并没有闷着头努力，因为我始终觉得不能在战术层面努力掩盖战略上的懒惰。所以我发现我的目标被简单的分为了两类，一类是深耕国内技术与文化圈，但始终突破不了内卷与上限，还要面对肉眼可见的注定的一眼望到头的命运，好处是比较安逸，但我内心知道，这不是我想要的。一类是通过狠狠的学习英语，考过雅思，将英语作为了我的第二语言，接着可以融入世界技术圈，接触一线技术，学习新知识可以直接看论文，与世界级的开发者深入交流，加入他们的圈子，大大提高我的天花板，从维度上突破我在国内的命运，并且也有很高的下限：在国外互联网工作至少不会有中年危机，可以 WLB。上限也很高，无论是 进军 web3，学习新技术，接私活，做独立开发者推广自己的产品，英语圈的市场无论是付费意识还是工作氛围都要比国内好上一大截！缺点是充满未知与不确定性。但，这正是我的“你究竟想活出怎样的人生”的答案！

"What kind of life do you really want to live?" This is definitely a question that hits the depths of the soul. As we grow up and become more mature, when facing the surrounding environment, starting to summarize the past, think about the future, and deal with the present, we often have such confusion: things seem okay now, but maybe they could be better, or maybe worse. Should I live in the moment? But I can't just live in the moment. The past is over. Am I going to repeat days like today for my whole life? I'm not willing, I don't accept it, and I don't want to admit defeat. But we've tried hard. However, it seems that nothing has changed much. Even those people around us, movie characters, and those who we thought were ahead actually have all kinds of troubles. I started to give up. But deep down inside, we still can't find the answer. But recently, I found that the answer is hidden in the question.
The question "What kind of life do you really want to live?" itself contains reform and change. Only a brand - new planet full of opportunities, challenges, and freshness is the life we want. The way masters solve problems is never to face the problem itself, but to think at a higher level.
Specifically, "Pessimists are right, but optimists move forward." I used to think that I was not satisfied with the current situation because I had too many desires. But now, even though my desires have decreased a lot compared to before, I'm still not satisfied. Then I suddenly realized a cruel thing: humans need to constantly combat entropy. So my later thought became to be optimistic but based on pessimism. Because my pessimism is to prevent myself from falling into a pessimistic situation, not to be led by pessimism. If it's just about desires, I can simply give them up. But facing possible layoffs, health problems, the passing of youth, not being able to travel abroad, and not being able to freely do what I love make me think about solutions.
I'm different from many of my peers and even older people around me. I've thought about and deduced countless possible results, including learning AI, looking for better big - data job opportunities in big cities like Shenzhen, getting involved in web3 to make money, investing, even gambling, taking on side jobs, joining foreign companies, becoming an independent developer, and working for foreign internet companies. I've started to do each step and advanced and deduced them with the help of AI products. But I'm not just working hard blindly. Because I always think that I can't cover up strategic laziness with tactical efforts. So I found that my goals are simply divided into two types. One is to deeply develop in the domestic technology and cultural circle. But I can never break through the involution and the upper limit, and I have to face a foreseeable, unchanging future. The advantage is that it's comfortable, but I know in my heart that this is not what I want. The other is to study English hard, pass the IELTS, and make English my second language. Then I can integrate into the world technology circle, access first - line technologies, read research papers directly to learn new knowledge, communicate deeply with world - class developers, join their circles, and greatly raise my ceiling. This can break through my fate in China in terms of dimension. And it also has a high bottom line: working in a foreign internet company at least won't have a mid - life crisis, and I can have a good work - life balance (WLB). The upper limit is also high. Whether it's entering web3, learning new technologies, taking on side jobs, promoting my products as an independent developer, the market in the English - speaking world, whether in terms of payment awareness or work atmosphere, is much better than that in China! The disadvantage is that it's full of unknowns and uncertainties. But this is exactly the answer to my "What kind of life do you really want to live?" question!
★★进阶版：
"What on earth kind of life do you aspire to lead?" This is undoubtedly a question that strikes deep into the recesses of the soul. As we gradually mature and grow, when confronted with the surrounding environment, reflecting on the past, pondering over the future, and grappling with the present, we often find ourselves grappling with such dilemmas: things seem to be going fairly well at present, yet there's a sense that they could potentially be enhanced, or conversely, deteriorate. Should I focus on living in the moment? However, I can't confine myself solely to the present. The past is irretrievably gone. Am I destined to repeat days similar to today for the entirety of my life? I'm filled with a sense of reluctance, a refusal to accept this, and a determination not to yield. Yet, we've made our efforts, and still, it appears that little has changed significantly. Even those around us, characters in movies, and those we believed were more advanced in life are, in reality, beset with various discontents. I began to waver in my resolve. Nevertheless, deep within our souls, the answer remains elusive. But recently, I've unearthed that the answer lies concealed within the question itself.
The query "What on earth kind of life do you aspire to lead?" inherently encompasses the notions of reform and transformation. Only a novel, vibrant world brimming with opportunities, challenges, and novelty represents the life we yearn for. Masters in problem - solving never merely confront the problem at hand; instead, they elevate their thinking to a higher dimension.
Specifically, the adage "Pessimists may be right, but optimists forge ahead" has taken on new meaning for me. I once assumed that my discontent with the status quo stemmed from my excessive desires. Yet, even after a substantial reduction in my desires compared to the past, my dissatisfaction persists. This realization led me to a harsh truth: humans are constantly engaged in a battle against entropy. Consequently, my subsequent approach has been to maintain an optimistic outlook, yet ground it in a foundation of pessimism. My brand of pessimism serves as a safeguard, preventing me from succumbing to a pessimistic mindset rather than allowing it to dictate my actions. While I could potentially discard certain desires, the impending threats of layoffs, deteriorating health, the passage of youth, the inability to travel abroad, and the constraints on pursuing my passions compel me to seek solutions.
I diverge from many of my peers and even some older individuals around me in that I've contemplated and simulated numerous potential outcomes. These include delving into AI, seeking superior big - data job prospects in metropolises like Shenzhen, venturing into web3 for financial gain, investing, and even considering more extreme measures like gambling. I've also thought about taking on freelance work, joining foreign - owned enterprises, becoming an independent developer, or securing employment with international internet companies. I've embarked on each of these paths and advanced my exploration with the assistance of AI - powered products. However, I'm acutely aware not to immerse myself in mindless toil. I firmly believe that one should not mask strategic indolence with frenetic tactical efforts. As a result, I've categorized my objectives into two primary types. One is to immerse myself deeply in the domestic technology and cultural landscape. Nevertheless, I'm acutely aware that I'm likely to become ensnared in a cycle of involution, unable to breach the upper limits, and destined to face a foreseeable, unchanging future. Although this path offers a certain degree of comfort, I'm cognizant that it doesn't align with my true aspirations. The other option is to rigorously study English, pass the IELTS, and establish English as my second language. This would enable me to integrate seamlessly into the global technology community, gain access to cutting - edge technologies, directly engage with research papers to acquire new knowledge, interact in - depth with world - class developers, and ultimately elevate my potential. This approach has the potential to transcend the limitations imposed by my domestic circumstances. Moreover, it offers a relatively high baseline: working in a foreign internet company would, at the very least, shield me from the specter of a mid - life crisis and afford me a healthy work - life balance (WLB). The upside is also substantial. Whether it's venturing into web3, exploring new technologies, taking on freelance projects, or promoting my products as an independent developer, the English - speaking market, in terms of payment willingness and work environment, far surpasses that of China. The caveat, of course, is the inherent uncertainty and unpredictability. But this, without a doubt, represents the answer to my existential query: "What on earth kind of life do you aspire to lead?"
★★★高级版：
"What manner of life do you truly wish to carve out for yourself?" This is indubitably a question that penetrates the innermost recesses of the soul. As we traverse the journey of maturation, navigating the vicissitudes of the surrounding milieu, engaging in retrospection of the past, ruminating on the future, and grappling with the exigencies of the present, we often find ourselves ensnared in a web of quandaries: the present seems to be in a state of equilibrium, yet there lingers an intimation that it could be optimized, or perhaps plunge into a state of decline. Should I embrace the philosophy of living in the moment? Alas, I cannot confine my existence to the temporal now. The past has receded into the annals of history, and the prospect of replicating the quotidian rhythms of today ad infinitum fills me with a sense of unease. I am imbued with a spirit of recalcitrance, a refusal to acquiesce to mediocrity, and an unwavering determination not to succumb to defeat. Despite our earnest endeavors, it appears as though the fabric of our circumstances remains largely unaltered. Even those in our immediate vicinity, the characters we encounter in the realm of cinema, and those we perceive as having forged ahead in life are, in reality, burdened with a litany of discontents. I began to falter in my resolve, contemplating retreat. Yet, deep within the recesses of our being, the answer to this existential query remains tantalizingly elusive. However, of late, I have discerned that the solution lies latent within the question itself.
The inquiry, "What manner of life do you truly wish to carve out for yourself?" is inherently imbued with the seeds of transformation and evolution. Only a nascent, dynamic universe teeming with opportunities, challenges, and a sense of novelty can satiate our yearning for a fulfilling existence. The sagacious approach to problem - solving eschews a direct confrontation with the problem at its surface level; rather, it entails an elevation of one's cognitive perspective to a higher echelon.
Specifically, the aphorism "Pessimists may hold the truth, yet optimists propel themselves forward" has undergone a profound reinterpretation in my consciousness. I once attributed my discontent with the status quo to the voraciousness of my desires. However, even after a significant attenuation of my desires in comparison to my former self, a sense of dissatisfaction persists. This realization has unmasked a harsh verity: humanity is perpetually engaged in a Sisyphean struggle against the forces of entropy. Consequently, my subsequent modus operandi has been to cultivate an optimistic disposition, yet anchor it in a bedrock of realism. My brand of pessimism serves as a prophylactic, safeguarding me from descending into the abyss of despair, rather than allowing it to dictate the course of my actions. While certain desires may be relinquished with relative ease, the specter of impending layoffs, the erosion of physical well - being, the inexorable passage of youth, the curtailment of travel aspirations, and the constraints on pursuing one's passions compel me to embark on a quest for viable alternatives.
I distinguish myself from many of my contemporaries and even some of my elders in that I have engaged in an extensive exercise of contemplation and simulation of myriad potential trajectories. These encompass delving into the arcane realm of AI, seeking out superior opportunities in the domain of big - data in megacities such as Shenzhen, venturing into the speculative landscape of web3, engaging in investment endeavors, and even entertaining the notion of more extreme pursuits such as gambling. I have also considered taking on freelance assignments, affiliating myself with foreign - owned enterprises, establishing myself as an independent developer, or pursuing employment with international internet behemoths. I have initiated steps along each of these paths, leveraging the capabilities of AI - enabled products to propel my exploration forward. However, I am acutely aware of the perils of engaging in mindless toil, recognizing that one should not obscure strategic inertia with frenetic tactical exertions. As a result, I have bifurcated my objectives into two distinct categories. One is to immerse myself in the domestic landscape of technology and culture, yet I am cognizant of the impending quagmire of involution and the glass ceiling that restricts my upward mobility, condemned to a future that is both foreseeable and circumscribed. While this path may offer a semblance of comfort, I am acutely aware that it fails to resonate with the depths of my aspirations. The alternative is to embark on a rigorous odyssey of English language acquisition, surmount the challenges of the IELTS, and establish English as my lingua franca. This would enable me to integrate seamlessly into the global community of technological innovators, gain unfettered access to the vanguard of technological advancements, engage directly with the corpus of academic research to glean new knowledge, and foster profound connections with world - class developers, thereby expanding the horizons of my potential. This approach has the potential to transcend the limitations imposed by my domestic circumstances, affording me a higher threshold of possibility. Moreover, it offers a robust safety net: employment within the international internet arena would, at the very least, insulate me from the specter of a mid - life crisis and enable me to achieve a harmonious work - life balance (WLB). The upside is equally tantalizing. Whether it's venturing into the uncharted territories of web3, exploring emerging technologies, taking on freelance projects, or promoting my products as an independent developer, the English - speaking market, in terms of payment acumen and work culture, outshines its domestic counterpart by a significant margin. The caveat, however, is the omnipresent specter of uncertainty and unpredictability.

💡Attention is all you need Notebook 论文笔记尝试版
    AI时代轰轰烈烈又润物细无声的来了，它比以往任何时代都更先进、迅速且全面，可以说任何传统行业都值得被AI重新赋能一遍。于个体而言，作为一个勉强算是的AI专业先驱兴趣与使用者，它极大的提升了我生活的方方面面，可以说我现在已经完全离不开AI了！它如此重要且与你我息息相关，但今天我不聊AI应用和它带来的变革，而是聊一聊我更好奇的那篇奠定当前AI发展的可以说最具革命性的一篇论文《Attention is all you need》。
    首先讲一下背景，我为何突然对它感兴趣，除了它特别重要之外，还有一个更重要的自私的原因。科技是一把双刃剑，随着AI发展，人类对它的阴谋论和恐惧效应也随之高涨，但作为个体来说，我前面讲过，至少我当前是收益远远大于那些未知的风险。好了，这里我不再啰嗦卖关子了，我直接说原因：因为我在实际使用AI时经常会遇到他的瓶颈。AI作为一个崭新的，某种程度上高维的一个新存在，我却常常在遇到稍微让他解决复杂工程问题时表现的特别笨拙，跟别人吹的和广告的说的一句话怎样怎样完全不符合，这时候我突然想起了芒格先生思想，大概意思是：如果你手里只有一把锤子，那你看谁都是钉子。当我初期开始尝到AI的甜头后，我确实看谁都是钉子，有事没事都想锤一下，哈哈哈。说到这里，肯定又需要一个转折，就是前面提到，当我用的越深时，我越要撒娇的提起另一个芒格思想：能力边界是指一个人清楚自己能力所及的范围，知道自己能胜任什么、不能胜任什么，了解自己的长处和短处。我豁然开朗，因为如果你确实有能力，你就会非常清楚能力圈的边界在哪里；如果你问起 “自己是否超出了能力圈”，那就意味着你已经在圈子之外了。于是这让一个很擅长偷懒的我（所以我更倾向于拥抱AI，因为本质上更喜欢偷懒）对这一切的起源，那篇后来被各大公司争先模仿引用的“XX is all you need”，比如，《Sleep Is All You Need》：程序员自嘲训练模型时通宵达旦的苦逼日常。《Money Is All You Need》：网友对 AI 行业烧钱现象的戏谑。甚至埃隆・马斯克曾在公开场合抛出一个黑色幽默：
「人们需要 transformer（变压器）来运行 transformer（模型）。这些 transformer 正在耗尽 transformer。」
另外提一句，写到这里，我觉得我有点TED风格了，但是写作真的能反推我深度思考和复盘总结，形成自身能力和英语的螺旋上升，我想我以后会坚持下去
    接下来我终于要开始写正事了对吧，放心，这次也不会有但是了。 大数据给我推送的学习视频是这个https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1xoJwzDESD/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=aa73c19014f4c25c3faa202e28e40096，刚开始被小姐姐娇柔的声音所吸引，看了一会儿后发现又有点东西，属于有深度的享受哈哈哈。以下是我的回忆与逻辑整理。
    论文开始先讲了一下背景，以往处理序列的任务主流是RNN、CNN，但他们存在几个问题，一是由于是递归顺序计算结构，导致无法并行，效率低下，二是由于需要不断的增加隐藏状态，导致模型在处理长输入时计算量激增，且由于没有重点导致难以捕捉远距离依赖问题。以上两个短板一直限制了AI的发展。而这篇论文提出的新架构Transformer大胆创新性的完全基于自注意力机制，规避了前面两个问题，让模型能够并行计算且根据训练权重关注到需要的相关内容，大幅提高了训练效率和长输入中有效信息的捕捉能力。
    介绍完背景我们看一下他的架构
    首先它依旧采用了编码器-解码器架构，不同的是它完全基于自注意力机制。那为什么要沿用编码器-解码器架构呢，我的理解是为了解决输入和输出不等长的场景，比如扩写和总结任务，或者翻译“我爱水课”为“i love easy water”。编码器负责理解英文的含义，解码器负责生成对应的中文。然后我们举例一个翻译任务经过这个架构发生了什么。首先我们输入“我爱水课”，这四个字会先转换为机器识别的词嵌入：input embedding，形成一个 512 维向量，然后给每个向量加入位置编码Position Encoding生成一个带有位置的词向量，为什么要加入位置信息呢，因为“狗咬人”和“人咬狗”完全是两个意思。然后“我爱水课”就变成了 512 维的向量+位置编码。接着进入多头注意力：Multi-Head Attention，这里将位置词向量分别乘以Q、K、V矩阵，三个矩阵分别对应query、key、value也就是查询、键、值。为什么要设计 QKV 分离或者这样分有什么好处呢，本质上是为了让模型理解复杂语言结构：如何提问，如何标记，如何提取。这里你要去图书馆查询一本书举例：Q 我想找关于人工智能的书籍、K《深度学习》，《神经网络》，《机器学习》、V是深度学习的概念，原理，实现过程，应用等书籍的实际内容。这里每个词都会进行QKV 的注意力机制查找，通过 Q与K 的匹配程度的到每个词的注意力权重，然后拿到对应的 V。而 QKV 是通过大量的机器学习的梯度下降和反向传播学到的。到这里还没完，前面只是单头注意力，Transformer 设计了多头注意力，然后这里为什么是多头一般是8头注意力呢，本质上是将512维的向量分成了8个不同种类的信息，每个头都是 64维度，类似现在流行的MOE混合专家架构，比如西瓜和菠萝很多不同纬度的特征，比如甜度、颜色、形状等，多头注意力是为了把这些不同的特征进行分类为口味、颜色、形状等几个大类来提升精度，大概就是这个意思。多头的好处在于可以并行执行、获得更加丰富的语义信息、从不同角度去理解、提升模型的鲁棒性。所以我们使用AI 时常常会觉得它的思想深度很深。到这里还没完，更牛的还在后边。通过多头注意力后模型会进入前馈神经网络，前馈神经网络会把信息再扩展到2048 维以了解更多的语义信息，然后经过 ReLU 函数过滤到无用信息，最后再压缩回 512 维。这也是模型有些啰嗦的底层原理。当然这整个过程都需要残差连接NX，因为信息会随着传递逐渐衰减，残差连接就是为了保证信息能传递到深层和保留原始目标不偏离。
• 注意力机制：负责"我应该关注什么"
• 前馈网络：负责"我应该如何理解这些信息"
这里举一个实际的例子：你是一家AI 初创公司的领导。现在你想开发一个自己的LLM 模型 Q，接着你让负责业务A部门的项目经理叫上各个负责人K开会，然后他们给出了各自的观点 V，在这期间你又同时叫了业务B 部门的项目经理也进行了本部分的开会讨论Multi-Head Attention，最后你让秘书整理了一份会议纪要，包含了你的 Q 要关注的哪些信息方向注意力分数，然后把这些信息交给每个员工再次去扩散搜集更全面的具体的信息和方法前馈神经网络，最后再做一份最终的PPT ReLU呈现给你。在这期间秘书负责了一份项目管理文档来保证每个部门之间的协同和核心信息不丢失残差连接。
20250922 Every Day Without Dancing Is a Betrayal of Life
每一个不曾起舞的日子，都是对生命的辜负
    今天是悲秋的其中一天，2025 年 09 月 22 日。今天一整天我的心情都非常的低落，感觉一切都提不起兴趣，我觉得我的人生无望。我骗自己说是因为没钱，我也跟同事表现了一下，他同样提到了是没钱的原因，或者具体点说是没有足够的钱去玩。可我在下楼梯的时候只有我自己内心知道，这无关乎金钱。因为很久之前，也不是很久，我有过类似今天这样的相同感受，那时候我还有一些存款，所以我确信这无关乎金钱，至少它不是主要因素。那么郑逸晗，郑鑫鑫，是什么让你的内心如此空洞呢，以至于让你头顶的天空灰的像失恋呢。
    我想我无法找到答案。我精确的计算了很多东西，我的人生规划，我的事业，我的存款，我的金融知识，我的财商，我的风险控制，我的技术能力。但我的精神正在一点点匮乏，这么想来，我有今天的情况是必然的。我沉迷于 AI 的杠杆帮我去创造，可我越来越无法从创造中获得快乐，这是一个恶性循环。AI它实实在在的带给我很大的便利，但它更无情的剥夺了我更多的东西。讽刺的是，最近一次快乐好像是发现了 figma make 这个AI 还做的不错。也许未来的我，来自另一个维度的我，他在努力的用他一生来给我传递一个消息。AI 剥夺了你的创造力，所以我不想“我”也这样。谢谢伟大的他。所以时隔好久，我又来创造了。
    好的电影总是令人发省的，我急需一个人来倾诉，我想到了我的女朋友吴晓蝶，我也同时想到了我许久未见的朋友鑫鑫，可我心里还是不太满意，因为历史证明或者第六感告诉我她们并不能拯救我。“人最大的敌人永远是自己”。我用疯狂的饮食妄图填满我的胃，填满我的心灵，外卖给我打电话的那一刻，我以为我抓住了今天的解药，哪怕只能治疗今天也足够了，明天应该会好吧。所以我没有一天像今天一样心里没底的漫无目的的快速回家。可是我差点忘了放在架子上的外卖。我欺骗着自己把曾经很喜欢冒着下雨天去吃的牛肉粉吃完。果然如我之前预料的一般，这一点作用都没有生效。可我还是继续加餐！！！，我的仅存的理性告诉我，吃饱了就会早点睡觉，这样这糟糕的一天就可以过去了。哈哈，从结果来看，并没有。
    我打开了《查克的一生》后半段，这部电影治愈了我，上一次治愈我的电影还是《本杰明.巴顿奇事》，这部电影的前半段很抽象也很无聊。直到富有磁性的旁白声音加入，我本能的觉得不简单，但是我该死的追求这个氛围，我把想学习英语的无聊的念头加进来了，于是就没继续下去。但是庆幸的是我欣赏了全局最高潮的一段他的舞蹈，他向命运、宇宙、虚无、万物归寂的熵，跳出了他自己的舞蹈，富有他独一无二的宇宙以意义的舞蹈，在他仅有的 0.00000000001 秒客观宇宙里，他向这个无情的宇宙做出了猛烈的一击，我们很渺小，但我们是存在，我们会舞蹈，就像天上的星星一样，或者像流星一样。
    幸运的是，我可以通过创作来找回我的掌控感，原来真正有意义的是在中学时代的一次元旦晚会上，你可以跟喜欢的女孩一起舞蹈，更有意义的是，在长大的成年人中，可以做一次纯粹的小孩。无关乎金钱，更无关乎所谓纯粹的数学和程序。而是写作，表达，诗歌，舞蹈，音乐，艺术。我想这一刻，我感到了前所未有的富足，这一切，同样，无关乎金钱。我很安定，不需要通过消耗其他人来实现，不需要酒精、毒品。谢谢你，另一个时空的自己：每一个不曾起舞的日子，都是对生命的辜负。
人类始终对抗的与熵相关的概念，或许可以从熵的本质来理解。熵在热力学中代表系统的无序程度，在信息论里表示信息的不确定性。人类文明的发展过程，其实就是在不断地与熵增作斗争。
熵增意味着系统从有序走向无序，从低熵状态变为高熵状态。而人类通过自身的智慧和努力，创造出各种秩序、规则和技术，试图维持或降低系统的熵值。例如，在生活中，我们整理房间、规划时间，是在对抗生活空间和时间安排上的熵增；在科学技术领域，工程师们设计高效的能源系统、优化生产流程，是在对抗能源利用和生产过程中的熵增。
所以，人类始终对抗的可以说是“熵增”。它象征着无序、混乱和衰退，而人类的进步就是一场不断战胜熵增、追求有序和发展的征程。

Every Day Without Dancing Is a Betrayal of Life
Today, September 22, 2025, is one of those days when I feel sad in autumn. I've been in a really low mood all day. I'm not interested in anything and I think my life is hopeless. I tricked myself into thinking it was because of lack of money. I told my colleague about it and he also said it was because of money, or more precisely, not having enough money to have fun. But when I was going down the stairs, I knew in my heart that it had nothing to do with money. Because not long ago, I had the same feeling as today. At that time, I still had some savings. So I'm sure it's not about money, at least not the main factor. So, Zheng Yihan, Zheng Xinxin, what makes your heart so empty that your sky looks as gray as after a breakup?
probablity
I don't think I can find the answer. I've calculated a lot of things precisely, like my life plan, my career, my savings, my financial knowledge, my financial quotient, my risk control, and my technical ability. But my spirit is getting poorer bit by bit. Thinking about it, it's inevitable that I'm in this situation today. I'm addicted to using the leverage of AI to create, but I'm getting less and less happy from creating. It's a vicious cycle. AI has really brought me a lot of convenience, but it has also taken away more from me mercilessly. Ironically, the last time I was happy was when I found that the AI, figma make, was quite good. Maybe in the future, me from another dimension is trying hard to send me a message with his whole life. AI has taken away your creativity, so I don't want "myself" to be like this either. Thank you, great me in the future. So after a long time, I start creating again.
Good movies always make people think. I really needed someone to talk to. I thought of my girlfriend, Wu Xiaodie, and also my long - time - no - see friend, Xinxin. But I'm still not quite satisfied because history or my sixth sense tells me they can't save me. "A person's biggest enemy is always himself." I tried to fill my stomach and my heart with crazy eating. When the delivery guy called me, I thought I had caught today's cure. Even if it could only cure me for today, it would be enough. Tomorrow should be better. So I've never gone home as aimlessly and quickly as today, feeling so uncertain. But I almost forgot the takeout on the shelf. I forced myself to finish the beef noodles that I used to like to eat in the rain. As I expected, it didn't work at all. But I still had more food! My remaining rationality told me that if I was full, I could go to bed earlier and this terrible day would be over. Haha, as it turned out, it didn't work.
I watched the second half of "The Life of Chuck". This movie cured me. The last movie that cured me was "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button". The first half of this movie was very abstract and boring. Until the magnetic voice - over came in, I instinctively felt it was not simple. But I was obsessed with the atmosphere and added the boring idea of learning English, so I didn't continue. But fortunately, I watched the climax part of the whole movie, his dance. He danced to fate, the universe, nothingness, and the entropy of everything returning to silence. He danced a dance that gave meaning to his unique universe. In his objective universe of only 0.00000000001 seconds, he made a fierce blow to this ruthless universe. We are very small, but we exist. We can dance, just like the stars in the sky, or like meteors.
Fortunately, I can regain my sense of control through creation. It turns out that what's really meaningful is that in a New Year's party in middle school, you can dance with the girl you like. And it's even more meaningful that as an adult, you can be a pure child. It has nothing to do with money, nor with so - called pure math and programs. It's about writing, expressing, poetry, dancing, music, and art. I think at this moment, I feel an unprecedented sense of richness. All this, again, has nothing to do with money. I'm very calm. I don't need to consume others to achieve it. I don't need alcohol or drugs. Thank you, myself from another time and space: Every day without dancing is a betrayal of life.
The concept related to entropy that humans have always been fighting against may be understood from the essence of entropy. In thermodynamics, entropy represents the degree of disorder of a system. In information theory, it represents the uncertainty of information. The development process of human civilization is actually a continuous struggle against entropy increase.
Entropy increase means that a system goes from order to disorder, from a low - entropy state to a high - entropy state. And humans, through their wisdom and efforts, create various orders, rules, and technologies to try to maintain or reduce the entropy value of the system. For example, in daily life, when we clean the room and plan our time, we are fighting against the entropy increase in our living space and time arrangement. In the field of science and technology, engineers design efficient energy systems and optimize production processes to fight against the entropy increase in energy utilization and production.
So, what humans have always been fighting against can be said to be "entropy increase". It symbolizes disorder, chaos, and decline, while human progress is a journey of constantly defeating entropy increase and pursuing order and development.

Every Day Without Dancing Is a Betrayal of Life
Today, September 22, 2025, is one of those autumnal days that plunge me into melancholy. I've been in the doldrums throughout the day, finding myself disinterested in everything, convinced that my life holds no promise. I initially deceived myself into believing that it was the lack of funds that was plaguing me. I shared my woes with a colleague, and he too attributed it to money, or rather, the insufficiency of it to indulge in recreational pursuits. However, as I descended the stairs, I was acutely aware that the root cause lay elsewhere. Not long ago, I had experienced a similar sense of despondency, and at that time, I still had some savings. Thus, I'm certain that money is not the primary culprit. So, Zheng Yihan, Zheng Xinxin, what on earth is it that renders your heart so hollow, casting a pall of gray over your world, reminiscent of a broken - hearted state?
I doubt I can unearth the answer. I've painstakingly calculated numerous aspects of my life: my life plan, career prospects, savings, financial acumen, risk management, and technical proficiency. Yet, my spiritual well - being is gradually withering away. On reflection, it seems almost inevitable that I find myself in this predicament today. I've become ensnared in the allure of using AI as a leverage for creation, yet the joy I derive from it is diminishing with each passing day. It's a vicious cycle. AI has undeniably bestowed upon me substantial convenience, but it has also callously snatched away much from me. Ironically, the last instance of genuine happiness I experienced was upon discovering that the AI, figma make, was rather impressive. Perhaps in some distant future, a version of myself from another dimension is striving to convey a crucial message to me through his life's journey. AI has eroded your creativity, and I don't wish for "myself" to meet the same fate. Thank you, my future self. And so, after a prolonged hiatus, I've once again embarked on the path of creation.
Thought - provoking movies often come to the rescue in such moments. I desperately needed someone to confide in, and my mind immediately conjured up images of my girlfriend, Wu Xiaodie, and my long - lost friend, Xinxin. Nevertheless, a nagging sense of dissatisfaction persisted, as past experiences and an intuitive sixth sense warned me that they might not be the saviors I sought. "One's greatest adversary is invariably oneself." I resorted to compulsive eating, hoping to satiate not only my physical hunger but also the emptiness within. When the delivery person called, I clung to the hope that I had found the panacea for this dismal day. Even if it could only alleviate my suffering for the present, it would suffice, for surely tomorrow would be brighter. And so, I hastened home with an uncharacteristic sense of aimlessness, my heart filled with unease. However, I nearly forgot about the takeout perched on the shelf. I forced myself to consume the beef noodles that I once relished, even in the rain. Predictably, it had no effect in lifting my spirits. But I persisted in overeating! My remaining vestige of rationality whispered that a full stomach would lead to an early slumber, effectively bringing this wretched day to a close. Alas, as events transpired, my hopes were dashed.
I then delved into the second half of "The Life of Chuck". This film had a therapeutic effect on me, much like "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" had in the past. The initial part of this movie was rather abstract and unengaging. However, when the resonant voice - over entered the fray, I instinctively sensed that there was more to it than met the eye. Yet, in my eagerness to immerse myself in the atmosphere, I foolishly introduced the tiresome thought of learning English, causing me to halt my viewing prematurely. Fortunately, I did manage to witness the film's most climactic moment: his dance. He danced defiantly against fate, the vast expanse of the universe, the void of nothingness, and the omnipresent entropy that threatens to plunge everything into oblivion. His dance was a proclamation of meaning in his unique cosmic narrative. In that minuscule fraction of 0.00000000001 seconds of the objective universe, he delivered a powerful blow to the heartless cosmos. We may be infinitesimal, but we exist. We can dance, just like the twinkling stars or shooting meteors in the night sky.
Thankfully, I've discovered that I can regain a sense of control over my life through creative endeavors. It dawns on me that true significance lies in those simple moments, such as dancing with a beloved girl at a middle - school New Year's party. And as an adult, the ability to embrace one's inner child is even more profound. It transcends the realm of money, as well as the cold realm of pure mathematics and programming. It's about the power of writing, expression, poetry, dance, music, and art. At this very moment, I feel an overwhelming sense of fulfillment, a richness that has nothing to do with material wealth. I'm at peace, not reliant on external validation or substances like alcohol or drugs. Thank you, my alter - ego from another dimension: Every day without dancing is a betrayal of life.
The concept related to entropy that humans have been perpetually grappling with can perhaps be grasped from its fundamental nature. In thermodynamics, entropy denotes the level of disorder within a system. In the realm of information theory, it represents the degree of uncertainty in information. The evolution of human civilization has essentially been an ongoing battle against entropy increase.
Entropy increase implies a transition from order to disorder, from a state of low entropy to one of high entropy. Through their ingenuity and hard work, humans strive to counteract this by creating various forms of order, rules, and technologies, aiming to maintain or decrease the system's entropy. For instance, in our daily lives, tidying our living spaces and organizing our schedules is a form of combatting entropy in our immediate environment. In the scientific and technological arena, engineers design efficient energy systems and streamline production processes to mitigate entropy in energy consumption and manufacturing.
Consequently, what humans have been steadfastly fighting against can be aptly described as "entropy increase". It symbolizes the forces of disorder, chaos, and decay, while human advancement is a continuous odyssey of vanquishing entropy increase and forging ahead towards order and progress.

Every Day Without Dancing Is a Betrayal of Life
Today, September 22, 2025, unfolds as one of those autumnal days that cast a shadow of melancholic introspection over me. The entire day, I've been ensnared in the clutches of a profound despondency, with every endeavor and object of the world seemingly drained of its allure. I find myself adrift in a sea of hopelessness, contemplating the seemingly futile trajectory of my life. Initially, I succumbed to the fallacy of blaming my financial situation for this malaise. I confided my distress to a colleague, who echoed my sentiment, positing that it was the dearth of funds, specifically the inability to afford leisurely pursuits, that lay at the heart of my discontent. However, as I descended the staircase, a profound realization dawned upon me. Not long ago, I had traversed a similar emotional landscape, despite possessing a modest savings. Thus, I am convinced that the root cause of my disquietude is not pecuniary; money, at best, is but a peripheral factor. So, Zheng Yihan, Zheng Xinxin, what is the enigmatic force that has hollowed out the very core of your being, shrouding your world in a veil of ashen despair, akin to the aftermath of a heart - rending separation?
I fear that the answer to this existential query may elude my grasp. I have meticulously calibrated and dissected various aspects of my life: my life's blueprint, professional aspirations, financial reserves, financial erudition, fiscal acumen, risk mitigation strategies, and technical prowess. And yet, paradoxically, my spiritual vitality is waning with each passing moment. Upon reflection, it seems almost inevitable that I find myself ensnared in this existential quagmire. I have become ensnared in the siren call of AI - assisted creation, leveraging its power to bring my ideas to fruition. However, the wellspring of joy that once accompanied my creative endeavors has gradually dried up, replaced by a sense of emptiness and dissatisfaction. It is a pernicious cycle, one in which AI, while ostensibly a tool for progress, has insidiously eroded the very essence of my creativity. Ironically, the most recent glimmer of happiness I experienced was upon discovering the AI - powered tool, figma make, which demonstrated a remarkable level of sophistication. Perhaps, in some distant cosmic iteration, a future version of myself is laboring ceaselessly to transmit a vital message across the vast expanse of time and space. AI has usurped your creative spark, and I implore you not to let "myself" succumb to the same fate. Thank you, my future self, for this timely admonition. And so, after a protracted hiatus, I once again embark on the arduous journey of self - discovery through creation.
In moments of profound despair, the solace of thought - provoking cinema often beckons. I yearned for a confidant, someone with whom I could unburden the weight of my existential angst. My mind immediately conjured images of my girlfriend, Wu Xiaodie, and my long - lost friend, Xinxin. Yet, a sense of unease gnawed at me, for past experiences and an intuitive premonition warned me that they might not be the panacea for my spiritual malaise. "The greatest antagonist one must confront is, invariably, oneself." In a desperate bid to fill the void within, I resorted to compulsive overeating, hoping to satiate not only my physical hunger but also the gnawing emptiness in my soul. When the deliveryman's call pierced the silence, I clung to the hope that I had stumbled upon the elixir to cure my existential woes, even if only for a fleeting moment. I thought, surely tomorrow will be brighter. And so, I hastened home with an uncharacteristic sense of urgency, my mind a whirlwind of aimlessness and anxiety. However, in my distracted state, I nearly forgot the takeout perched precariously on the shelf. I forced myself to consume the beef noodles, a dish I once relished with abandon, even in the midst of a torrential downpour. Predictably, the act of eating failed to assuage the tempest of emotions raging within me. Undeterred, I continued to indulge, driven by a primal urge to fill the void. My rational mind, a faint voice in the background, whispered that a full stomach would lead to a swift slumber, effectively putting an end to this wretched day. Alas, as the night wore on, I found myself still grappling with the demons of my despair.
It was then that I turned to the second half of "The Life of Chuck". This cinematic masterpiece, much like "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" before it, had a profound therapeutic effect on my troubled soul. The initial segments of the film were characterized by an abstract and esoteric narrative, which, while initially off - putting, gradually began to reveal its hidden depths. As the rich, resonant voice - over filled the airwaves, I instinctively sensed that I was on the cusp of a profound revelation. However, in my eagerness to fully immerse myself in the film's atmosphere, I made the fatal error of introducing the mundane thought of learning English, causing me to lose focus and temporarily abandon my viewing. Fortunately, I eventually returned to the film and was rewarded with the privilege of witnessing its most climactic moment: the protagonist's dance. In a breathtaking display of defiance, he danced against the very fabric of fate, the boundless expanse of the universe, the abyss of nothingness, and the inexorable march of entropy, which threatens to reduce all things to a state of inert chaos. His dance was not merely a physical act but a profound existential statement, a testament to the indomitable human spirit in the face of cosmic indifference. In that infinitesimal fraction of 0.00000000001 seconds of the objective universe, he delivered a resounding blow to the heartless cosmos, a declaration of his existence and his refusal to be consumed by the void. We may be but a speck in the vast cosmic tapestry, yet we possess the power to dance, to create, to infuse meaning into the otherwise meaningless expanse of the universe. We are like the stars, shining bright against the darkness, or like meteors, leaving an indelible mark as we streak across the sky.
Thankfully, I have come to realize that I can regain a sense of agency and control over my life through the transformative power of creation. True significance, I now understand, lies not in the trappings of
